The run_analysis.R file reads data from test and training datasets containing information on a range of measurements taken from 30 volunteers performing 
6 different activities. It merges the two datasets then calculates the average for only those measurements which deal with mean and standard deviation. 
It calculates the averages for each activity for each volunteer. The resulting tidy dataset has 180 observations.
